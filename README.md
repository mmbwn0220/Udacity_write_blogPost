Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using kaggle airbnb data from 2016 to better understand: • The vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions
• What are top most interested amenities renter provided
• Price range related with room type, property type and bed type
• To find if there is any correlation with accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, beds associated with price
• Build model to predict renting price
• Find most impacted features related to the price

File Descriptions

• Listings_Seattle.csv is data Source from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data Airbnb the listing activity of homestays in 2016 Seattle, WA.
• Udacity_project4 notebook file is to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
